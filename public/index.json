[{"content":"A brief explainer on what your credit card interest looks like.\nBreakdown Credit card interest is typically very high. As of 2024, it\u0026rsquo;s around 24% APR (annual percentage rate), which is an annoying way of saying about 2% every month. You can take your credit card’s APR and divide it by 12 to calculate the interest that will accrue on your balance each month. That ‘each month’ aspect of credit card interest makes it easy to fall into debt quickly if you’re not careful. If you bite off more than you can chew, you don’t have much time to fix the situation before the interest adds up. Let’s get into it.\nShow me the numbers Let’s run through an example of how quickly credit card debt can grow if you only make minimum payments. We\u0026rsquo;ll assume a starting balance of $1,000, an APR of 24%, and a minimum payment of $25.\nMonth-by-Month Breakdown Initial Balance: $1,000\nMonthly Interest Rate: 24% (APR) / 12 (months) = 2%\nMonth 1: Interest for the Month: $1,000 * 2% = $20\nNew Balance: $1,000 + $20 = $1,020\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,020 - $25 = $995\nMonth 2: Interest for the Month: $995 * 2% = $19.90\nNew Balance: $995 + $19.90 = $1,014.90\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,014.90 - $25 = $989.90\nMonth 3: Interest for the Month: $989.90 * 2% = $19.80\nNew Balance: $989.90 + $19.80 = $1,009.70\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,009.70 - $25 = $984.70\nSummary: Month 1: Start with $1,000, end with $995.\nMonth 2: Start with $995, end with $989.90.\nMonth 3: Start with $989.90, end with $984.70.\nNotice that despite making the minimum payment each month, the balance only reduces by a small amount (not $25), and a significant portion of each payment goes toward interest. After the 3rd month, you’ve paid $75(!) but the balance itself has only decreased by about $15 - the rest of that money went straight to your card company’s pocket. Poof, worst magic trick ever.\nIn fact, if you were to only pay minimum payments on that initial $1,000 balance it would take you almost 6 YEARS to pay it off, and in that time you would have paid over $1,000 in INTEREST (math). So to spend $1000, you spent $2000 - this is an extreme example in terms of length of time, but a very mild example when it comes to credit card balances. I’m pretty sure my first credit card at 18 had a $5,000 limit and I didn’t have $5,000 cash until I was well established in my career… at like 30 years old.\nLinks: math\nSo… credit card bad? Not necessarily, it’s kind of like a chainsaw… useful if you know what you’re doing but probably better to leave to someone else if you don’t.\nLuckily, understanding the stuff I listed above (not chainsaws, the credit card part) here more than likely puts you ahead of more of your friends and family than you’d be comfortable with.\nCredit cards can absolutely be beneficial, not just for building credit but also for the various perks and point systems they offer. My family and I primarily use the AMEX Gold card since a huge chunk of our monthly spending goes towards groceries (…and dining out…), both of which earn bonus points on that particular card. I won’t go into details or breakdowns of which credit card is right for you, as there are a ton of resources out there (I personally like nerdwallet’s comparisons and breakdowns). Suffice it to say, there is likely a card that will give you the best bang for your buck based on your spending habits.\nMy family puts everything possible on that AMEX, but we also ensure we have the cash to cover every transaction and pay off the balance in full every month. This strategy is great for points but not super beneficial for building credit, as credit companies like to see you can ‘responsibly’ carry a balance forward to future months (including the interest you’d get by not paying it off in full).\nIf building credit is something you need to do, you could keep a small balance (an amount you could pay off in full at any point) on a card and make either minimum payments or some other amount not in full, allowing that card to incur some interest charges as you pay it off over a few months. Once you’re near zeroing out the card, put some more purchases on it and then repeat the process as needed. By keeping only an amount on the card that you could pay off at any point, you can feel comfortable carrying that balance and the minor interest charges that would be incurred over a few months as opposed to a few years.\nThanks for reading!\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/credit-card-interest/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA brief explainer on what your credit card interest looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCredit card interest is typically very high.

The more you eat, the higher the tier you move into, but you only pay that higher price for the food you eat in that tier. In the U.S., tax brackets work similarly: your income is divided into chunks, and each chunk is taxed at a different rate. So, if you earn more, only the extra income in the higher bracket gets taxed at the higher rate, not your entire paycheck.\nShow me some examples Say you make $50,000 per year. When you break this down within the tax brackets (2022), it looks like:\n$10,275 taxed at 10% $31,500 taxed at 12% $8,225 taxed at 22% Math: Tier 1 ($0 - $10,275 @ 10%) Taxes taken out: $10,275 x .10 = $1,027.50\nMoney taken home: $10,275 - $1,027.50 = $9,247.50\nTier 2 ($10,276 - $41,775 @ 12%) Taxes taken out: $31,500 x .12 = $3,780\nMoney taken home: $31,500 - $3,780 = $27,720\nTier 3 ($41,776 - $50,000 @ 22%) Taxes taken out: $8,225 x .22 = $1,809.50\nMoney taken home: $8,225 - $1,809.50 = $6,415.50\nSo, in total:\nTaxes taken out: $1,027.50 + $3,780 + $1,809.50 = $6,617\nMoney taken home: $50,000 - $6,617 = $43,383\nThat, of course, is not the last of what’s going to be taken out of your paycheck - you’ve still got Social Security (6.2% as of 2023), state taxes (if your state has income tax), and any retirement/insurance(s)/etc. that you’ve elected to have withheld on your check.\nBoth Social Security and state income taxes are taken out at a flat rate, so you can just take that total income of $50,000 and multiply it by those percentages:\nSocial Security at 6.2%: $50,000 × 0.062 = $3,100\nThen a state income tax (example) at 5%: $50,000 × 0.05 = $2,500\nSo for someone earning $50,000 a year in a state with 5% income tax:\n$50,000 pre-tax income\n$6,617 in federal taxes\n$3,100 in Social Security\n$2,500 in state income tax\nLeaving them with a total of $37,783 take home pay before we factor in any health and/or life insurance, putting any money into an employer retirement account, or any other things they’ve elected to withhold from their check.\nSo, before any of that money lands in your account, you can count on just about 25% of it going to Uncle Sam and his folks - which is why having an employer-sponsored retirement account can be extremely beneficial as most of these use pre-tax dollars. This allows you to effectively reduce the amount of money going to taxes and save some for your future self via your retirement account (though Uncle Sam does eventually get his cut, at that point it will, hopefully, not affect your day-to-day spending quite so much).\nBonus I\u0026rsquo;ve come across several people in my life who say, \u0026lsquo;Oh, you better watch that raise though, it will end up with you in a higher tax bracket! It may not be worth it.\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip;. which is just \u0026hellip; so wrong it hurts. That\u0026rsquo;s like saying you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t eat more cake because you\u0026rsquo;ll need a bigger plate. Yes, you’ll pay a bit more tax on the extra money (and only that extra money!), but you\u0026rsquo;ll still end up with more cake in the end.

When you break this down within the tax brackets (2022), it looks like:\n$10,275 taxed at 10% $31,500 taxed at 12% $8,225 taxed at 22% Math: Tier 1 ($0 - $10,275 @ 10%) Taxes taken out: $10,275 x .10 = $1,027.50\nMoney taken home: $10,275 - $1,027.50 = $9,247.50\nTier 2 ($10,276 - $41,775 @ 12%) Taxes taken out: $31,500 x .12 = $3,780\nMoney taken home: $31,500 - $3,780 = $27,720\nTier 3 ($41,776 - $50,000 @ 22%) Taxes taken out: $8,225 x .22 = $1,809.50\nMoney taken home: $8,225 - $1,809.50 = $6,415.50\nSo, in total:\nTaxes taken out: $1,027.50 + $3,780 + $1,809.50 = $6,617\nMoney taken home: $50,000 - $6,617 = $43,383\nThat, of course, is not the last of what’s going to be taken out of your paycheck - you’ve still got Social Security (6.2% as of 2023), state taxes (if your state has income tax), and any retirement/insurance(s)/etc. that you’ve elected to have withheld on your check.\nBoth Social Security and state income taxes are taken out at a flat rate, so you can just take that total income of $50,000 and multiply it by those percentages:\nSocial Security at 6.2%: $50,000 × 0.062 = $3,100\nThen a state income tax (example) at 5%: $50,000 × 0.05 = $2,500\nSo for someone earning $50,000 a year in a state with 5% income tax:\n$50,000 pre-tax income\n$6,617 in federal taxes\n$3,100 in Social Security\n$2,500 in state income tax\nLeaving them with a total of $37,783 take home pay before we factor in any health and/or life insurance, putting any money into an employer retirement account, or any other things they’ve elected to withhold from their check.\nSo, before any of that money lands in your account, you can count on just about 25% of it going to Uncle Sam and his folks - which is why having an employer-sponsored retirement account can be extremely beneficial as most of these use pre-tax dollars. This allows you to effectively reduce the amount of money going to taxes and save some for your future self via your retirement account (though Uncle Sam does eventually get his cut, at that point it will, hopefully, not affect your day-to-day spending quite so much).\nBonus I\u0026rsquo;ve come across several people in my life who say, \u0026lsquo;Oh, you better watch that raise though, it will end up with you in a higher tax bracket! It may not be worth it.\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip;. which is just \u0026hellip; so wrong it hurts. That\u0026rsquo;s like saying you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t eat more cake because you\u0026rsquo;ll need a bigger plate. Yes, you’ll pay a bit more tax on the extra money (and only that extra money!), but you\u0026rsquo;ll still end up with more cake in the end.

After the 3rd month, you’ve paid $75(!) but the balance itself has only decreased by about $15 - the rest of that money went straight to your card company’s pocket. Poof, worst magic trick ever.\nIn fact, if you were to only pay minimum payments on that initial $1,000 balance it would take you almost 6 YEARS to pay it off, and in that time you would have paid over $1,000 in INTEREST (math). So to spend $1000, you spent $2000 - this is an extreme example in terms of length of time, but a very mild example when it comes to credit card balances. I’m pretty sure my first credit card at 18 had a $5,000 limit and I didn’t have $5,000 cash until I was well established in my career… at like 30 years old.\nLinks: math\nSo… credit card bad? Not necessarily, it’s kind of like a chainsaw… useful if you know what you’re doing but probably better to leave to someone else if you don’t.\nLuckily, understanding the stuff I listed above (not chainsaws, the credit card part) here more than likely puts you ahead of more of your friends and family than you’d be comfortable with.\nCredit cards can absolutely be beneficial, not just for building credit but also for the various perks and point systems they offer. My family and I primarily use the AMEX Gold card since a huge chunk of our monthly spending goes towards groceries (…and dining out…), both of which earn bonus points on that particular card. I won’t go into details or breakdowns of which credit card is right for you, as there are a ton of resources out there (I personally like nerdwallet’s comparisons and breakdowns). Suffice it to say, there is likely a card that will give you the best bang for your buck based on your spending habits.\nMy family puts everything possible on that AMEX, but we also ensure we have the cash to cover every transaction and pay off the balance in full every month. This strategy is great for points but not super beneficial for building credit, as credit companies like to see you can ‘responsibly’ carry a balance forward to future months (including the interest you’d get by not paying it off in full).\nIf building credit is something you need to do, you could keep a small balance (an amount you could pay off in full at any point) on a card and make either minimum payments or some other amount not in full, allowing that card to incur some interest charges as you pay it off over a few months. Once you’re near zeroing out the card, put some more purchases on it and then repeat the process as needed. By keeping only an amount on the card that you could pay off at any point, you can feel comfortable carrying that balance and the minor interest charges that would be incurred over a few months as opposed to a few years.\nThanks for reading!\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/credit-card-interest/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA brief explainer on what your credit card interest looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCredit card interest is typically very high.

As of 2024, it\u0026rsquo;s around 24% APR (annual percentage rate), which is an annoying way of saying about 2% every month. You can take your credit card’s APR and divide it by 12 to calculate the interest that will accrue on your balance each month. That ‘each month’ aspect of credit card interest makes it easy to fall into debt quickly if you’re not careful. If you bite off more than you can chew, you don’t have much time to fix the situation before the interest adds up. Let’s get into it.\nShow me the numbers Let’s run through an example of how quickly credit card debt can grow if you only make minimum payments. We\u0026rsquo;ll assume a starting balance of $1,000, an APR of 24%, and a minimum payment of $25.\nMonth-by-Month Breakdown Initial Balance: $1,000\nMonthly Interest Rate: 24% (APR) / 12 (months) = 2%\nMonth 1: Interest for the Month: $1,000 * 2% = $20\nNew Balance: $1,000 + $20 = $1,020\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,020 - $25 = $995\nMonth 2: Interest for the Month: $995 * 2% = $19.90\nNew Balance: $995 + $19.90 = $1,014.90\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,014.90 - $25 = $989.90\nMonth 3: Interest for the Month: $989.90 * 2% = $19.80\nNew Balance: $989.90 + $19.80 = $1,009.70\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,009.70 - $25 = $984.70\nSummary: Month 1: Start with $1,000, end with $995.\nMonth 2: Start with $995, end with $989.90.\nMonth 3: Start with $989.90, end with $984.70.\nNotice that despite making the minimum payment each month, the balance only reduces by a small amount (not $25), and a significant portion of each payment goes toward interest. After the 3rd month, you’ve paid $75(!) but the balance itself has only decreased by about $15 - the rest of that money went straight to your card company’s pocket. Poof, worst magic trick ever.\nIn fact, if you were to only pay minimum payments on that initial $1,000 balance it would take you almost 6 YEARS to pay it off, and in that time you would have paid over $1,000 in INTEREST (math). So to spend $1000, you spent $2000 - this is an extreme example in terms of length of time, but a very mild example when it comes to credit card balances. I’m pretty sure my first credit card at 18 had a $5,000 limit and I didn’t have $5,000 cash until I was well established in my career… at like 30 years old.\nSo… credit card bad? Not necessarily, it’s kind of like a chainsaw… useful if you know what you’re doing but probably better to leave to someone else if you don’t.\nLuckily, understanding the stuff I listed above (not chainsaws, the credit card part) here more than likely puts you ahead of more of your friends and family than you’d be comfortable with.\nCredit cards can absolutely be beneficial, not just for building credit but also for the various perks and point systems they offer. My family and I primarily use the AMEX Gold card since a huge chunk of our monthly spending goes towards groceries (…and dining out…), both of which earn bonus points on that particular card. I won’t go into details or breakdowns of which credit card is right for you, as there are a ton of resources out there (I personally like nerdwallet’s comparisons and breakdowns). Suffice it to say, there is likely a card that will give you the best bang for your buck based on your spending habits.\nMy family puts everything possible on that AMEX, but we also ensure we have the cash to cover every transaction and pay off the balance in full every month. This strategy is great for points but not super beneficial for building credit, as credit companies like to see you can ‘responsibly’ carry a balance forward to future months (including the interest you’d get by not paying it off in full).\nIf building credit is something you need to do, you could keep a small balance (an amount you could pay off in full at any point) on a card and make either minimum payments or some other amount not in full, allowing that card to incur some interest charges as you pay it off over a few months. Once you’re near zeroing out the card, put some more purchases on it and then repeat the process as needed. By keeping only an amount on the card that you could pay off at any point, you can feel comfortable carrying that balance and the minor interest charges that would be incurred over a few months as opposed to a few years.\nThanks for reading!\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/credit-card-interest/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA brief explainer on what your credit card interest looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCredit card interest is typically very high.

The more you eat, the higher the tier you move into, but you only pay that higher price for the food you eat in that tier. In the U.S., tax brackets work similarly: your income is divided into chunks, and each chunk is taxed at a different rate. So, if you earn more, only the extra income in the higher bracket gets taxed at the higher rate, not your entire paycheck.\nShow me some examples Say you make $50,000 per year. When you break this down within the tax brackets (2022), it looks like:\n$10,275 taxed at 10% $31,500 taxed at 12% $8,225 taxed at 22% Math: Tier 1 ($0 - $10,275 @ 10%) Taxes taken out: $10,275 x .10 = $1,027.50\nMoney taken home: $10,275 - $1,027.50 = $9,247.50\nTier 2 ($10,276 - $41,775 @ 12%) Taxes taken out: $31,500 x .12 = $3,780\nMoney taken home: $31,500 - $3,780 = $27,720\nTier 3 ($41,776 - $50,000 @ 22%) Taxes taken out: $8,225 x .22 = $1,809.50\nMoney taken home: $8,225 - $1,809.50 = $6,415.50\nSo, in total:\nTaxes taken out: $1,027.50 + $3,780 + $1,809.50 = $6,617\nMoney taken home: $50,000 - $6,617 = $43,383\nThat, of course, is not the last of what’s going to be taken out of your paycheck - you’ve still got Social Security (6.2% as of 2023), state taxes (if your state has income tax), and any retirement/insurance(s)/etc. that you’ve elected to have withheld on your check.\nBoth Social Security and state income taxes are taken out at a flat rate, so you can just take that total income of $50,000 and multiply it by those percentages:\nSocial Security at 6.2%: $50,000 × 0.062 = $3,100\nThen a state income tax (example) at 5%: $50,000 × 0.05 = $2,500\nSo for someone earning $50,000 a year in a state with 5% income tax:\n$50,000 pre-tax income\n$6,617 in federal taxes\n$3,100 in Social Security\n$2,500 in state income tax\nLeaving them with a total of $37,783 take home pay before we factor in any health and/or life insurance, putting any money into an employer retirement account, or any other things they’ve elected to withhold from their check.\nSo, before any of that money lands in your account, you can count on just about 25% of it going to Uncle Sam and his folks - which is why having an employer-sponsored retirement account can be extremely beneficial as most of these use pre-tax dollars. This allows you to effectively reduce the amount of money going to taxes and save some for your future self via your retirement account (though Uncle Sam does eventually get his cut, at that point it will, hopefully, not affect your day-to-day spending quite so much).\nBonus I\u0026rsquo;ve come across several people in my life who say, \u0026lsquo;Oh, you better watch that raise though, it will end up with you in a higher tax bracket! It may not be worth it.\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip;. which is just \u0026hellip; so wrong it hurts. That\u0026rsquo;s like saying you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t eat more cake because you\u0026rsquo;ll need a bigger plate. Yes, you’ll pay a bit more tax on the extra money (and only that extra money!), but you\u0026rsquo;ll still end up with more cake in the end. Err, money.\nThanks for reading!\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/tax-brackets/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA brief explainer on tax brackets and your paycheck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine you\u0026rsquo;re at an all-you-can-eat buffet with different price tiers based on the amount of food you actually consume.
