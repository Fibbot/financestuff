[{"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s get your $..tuff together.\nBreakdown Just in time for anyone wanting another New Years resolution, I’m gonna go into how to get a “financial snapshot”, otherwise known as “Ughhhhhhhh”. Look, I know it sucks - but seriously, if you don’t know where you’re at you can’t know where you’re going /endFortuneCookie. Plus you can knock it out in an hour or two then immediately mark “Figure out my finances” off your resolutions list. We’re not solving all your money troubles here, the goal is to get the full picture - deciding to tackle any problems that may arise can come later.\nThis is my first step every single time someone has come to me trying to change their financial situation, good or bad. How can we possibly figure out avenues to improve your situation if you don’t know what your situation really is? You wanna get out of debt? You want to retire at 40? You need to save for front row Taylor Swift tickets? If you are seriously wanting to change your financial situation, this has to be your first step (have you seen how expensive those tickets get???).\nWithout further soapboxing, let’s get into the…\nAttack Plan 1. Tally Your Monthly Bills List Out Everything: Rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, gas, phone bills, streaming services, gym memberships, etc.\nStart Adding: Write down the total due for each bill alongside its due date. This helps you see not just how much you owe but also when your bank account might look a little lighter.\nWhy It Matters: Gotta know your total money out every month. Don’t guess. If something’s variable, then get an average over a few months. I know it takes time but this is the longest part of this whole process, don’t slack here - it’s crucial. This also gives you a chance to potentially make some easy cuts if you find something you don’t really use anymore (like a streaming service you forgot you subscribed to for the Olympics).\n2. Identify All Debts \u0026amp; Their Interest Rates Credit Cards: Write down your balances and APRs (annual percentage rates).\nLoans: Student loans, personal loans, car loans—whatever it is, note both remaining balance and interest rate.\nWhy It Matters: Having a visual of your debts side by side helps you figure out a strategy and target to aim for if reducing debt is your next goal. When you can see that one debt is accruing interest at double the rate of another, it’s easier to know where to throw extra payments.\n3. Check Your Investments \u0026amp; Returns (If applicable) Where Are You Investing?: 401(k)? IRA? Under the mattress? Write it all down.\nAsset Allocation: Stocks, bonds, Incan matrimonial head masks, whatever - make sure it still aligns with your risk tolerance and future goals.\nReview Performance: Are you comfortable with your current returns? Are you too heavy into one sector? Are you happy with your current trajectory?\nWhy It Matters: If you’re investing, you want to know how your money is growing. If something’s not pulling its weight, it might be time to shuffle stuff around. The key is understanding what you own and why.\nFinally, bust out the ti-89 (… are those still a thing?) Start figuring out:\nIncome: How much is actually hitting your account each pay period after taxes, benefits, etc.? Expenses: Sum all the outflows we got earlier. Subtract stuff: Income minus expenses, that’s it. Dance hard techno: Congrats, you’ve done more for your financial future than 90% of the people I’ve worked with. All of that boiling down into “take your money in and subtract your money out” seems kind of ridiculous, but I have met very few people who have done this once in their life, let alone once a year. You’re not working off stuff in your head - you’re looking at your transaction history, you’re writing stuff down, you’re not being judgmental, not drawing conclusions - pure Vulcan on your finances. The impact of “Oh %$@# I spend $450/mo. on Door Dash!” when you told yourself “I probably spend like $50/mo. on Door Dash,” can’t be overstated (this is a true story from someone I worked with).\nWrap Up This snapshot is your baseline and from that baseline is where you start no matter what financial goal you have. Tackling debt? You now know which one is hurting you the most. Want to retire early? You now know how far you’ve got left. Those front row Taylor tickets? You now know you need to sell a kidney. Step one to any number of financial goals starts here.\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/financial-snapshot/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s get your $..tuff together.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJust in time for anyone wanting another New Years resolution, I’m gonna go into how to get a “financial snapshot”, otherwise known as “\u003cem\u003eUghhhhhhhh\u003c/em\u003e”.

Imagine someone rather unsavory in… I dunno, Louisiana, taking out a loan for a shiny new boat… in your name. Without your credit frozen, how would you even know? Credit reports reveal a wealth of useful information, from tracking your financial health to catching potential red flags like this. Additionally, at this point in our current technological cycle of “Everyone’s personal information has been leaked at some point and is purchasable online”, it’s a good idea to be proactive about checking on this stuff. In this week’s newsletter, we’re keeping it simple - walking you through how to pull your credit report and what surprises (good or bad 😬) you might uncover.\nThe ONLY site to use If you google “Free credit report”, you’re gonna get hit with 30 different websites, 5 ads, and 12 Amazon book recommendations. The only website that is provided by the government through the Free Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) is https://annualcreditreport.com - that’s it! You can also get credit reports directly from the 3 bureaus (Equifax, Transunion, Experian), but those will require you to create accounts with them and they do their best to put it behind popups and full-screen ads promising that if you just spend some money with them they’ll give you that report and SO MUCH MORE! Oh, and not to mention the spam you’ll get signed up for as well. Incredibly annoying.\nWith that link above you get to cut out all of the crap the bureaus give you on their site and get straight to the point. Also, if it wasn’t obvious in the name, this is a yearly thing, however, you can space out your reports as much as you want from the individual bureau’s throughout the year. Meaning, say March you run it with Experian, August with Transunion, and December with Equifax - that’s completely fine.\nYour free credit report is also considered a “soft pull” on your credit and is only visible to you, so running this has no affect on your credit score.\nLet’s do it live So I have not run my credit report this year and decided to go ahead and walk through the steps just in case they had any major changes before writing this, so let’s get through it.\nFirst you’re going to hit up https://annualcreditreport.com and hit “Request yours now!” on that top bar. Once you do that, you’ll be presented with:\nYou’ll be presented with a form that you’ll need to fill in with your personal information including name, social, address, etc. If you have not been at your current address more than 2 years, you’ll also need to provide any previous addresses within that time frame. After doing all that, you’ll reach:\nHere’s where you have a choice, you can run all three at the same time, or just select one you want to go through. Should you run all three? Should you just do one? Well, that’s completely up to you and what your goals are. They give some good advice below that:\nIf you are thinking about buying something big soon - a new car or even a home - you may want to get all of your credit reports now. That way you can correct any mistakes on all of them right away. If you are not planning a big purchase, requesting them over time might be a better choice. When you spread them out, watch for expected changes or suspicious activity throughout the year. Whichever strategy you choose, mark your calendar so you know when you can request your next free credit report.\nCan’t put it much better than that. Again, doing all of them or only one of them at a time will not affect your credit score in any way. Do what works for you.\nEach report will ask you to verify your identity via phone number and email address. If you’ve already got an account with the bureau(s) you’re running it on, use that email. If not, it’s kind of a crapshoot - but try the email you use the most (or know you have lines of credit registered to). I had to try a couple times with Transunion to find the right one.\nAfter verification, that’s it - you’ll have your credit report available to view and/or print off (or just save to pdf). Here’s some of the stuff included from my Equifax report:\nA lot of good stuff in here, such as:\nAll lines of credit you have open currently History of each credit line you’ve ever had, including if you made payments on time, current balance, limits, payment history, date opened/closed, etc. This is where you’d look through to make sure everything lines up with what you know about your credit history. See a line of credit you never opened? An old school loan you completely forgot about that’s gone delinquent? Time to start making phone calls!\nWrap up That about covers it, consider it your yearly checkup to make sure everything’s going as expected. And again, it’s free and doesn’t affect your credit score by doing it - so I highly recommend setting yourself a reminder and going through the trouble of getting it done yearly.\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/annual-credit-report/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eYour (\u003cem\u003egov\u0026rsquo;t mandated\u003c/em\u003e) free credit report and how to do it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy should you consider running a credit report on yourself?

It can either propel your investments/savings to new heights or drag you down into an endless grinding cycle. Understanding the dual nature of interest, both its benefits and risks, is key to using it effectively. Let’s get to it.\nThe Positive: Compound your wealth “Make your money work for you” - that’s interest in a nutshell. It’s the process of earning interest on your initial investment (or savings), plus the interest it has already earned (that’s the compounding part). Over time, this creates a snowball effect on your money’s growth.\nQuick example\nInvest $10,000 at 7% annual return (this is touted as the amount you can expect when investing BROADLY in something like the S\u0026amp;P500 over a 10+ year timeframe) After one year, you’ve earned $700, now you’re at $10,700 In the second year, that same 7% is now applied to your new $10,700 total, not just that initial $10,000 (“compounding” making an appearance again). So now you’re looking at $11,449… so on and so on through the years. By year 10, your investment has grown to nearly $20,000 without doing anything. Now imagine this sort of thing playing out over something like 30 years. That initial $10,000 grows to nearly $76,000! That is the power of time and interest. That’s another reason I’m a firm believer in “time in the market, not timing the market” (don’t try to pick a time to buy.. just consistently buy).\nThe Negative: That @#$% works both ways, fam Compound interest in your favor works great, but it also applies with the same power in the other direction. Credit cards, payday loans, and other high-interest debt can spiral out of control if left unchecked.\nQuick example\n$5,000 on your credit card, 24% APR - what now? You make the minimum payment of $150/month and because you’re only doing minimums, it takes you about 4 years to pay off the balance. During that time, you’ll have paid more than $3,000 in interest alone… more than half the original amount you threw on the card. Blergh Debt with high interest rates grow faster than most people can pay them down, which is why it’s crucial to be aggressive about paying them off when you’re able to. Prioritizing debt repayment with the highest interest rates can save you crazy amounts of money over time.\nWrap Up A tl;dr to remember: For investments and savings, time is your ally. For debt, time is your enemy.\nInterest isn’t inherently good nor bad - it’s just a tool. When you can use it to your benefit, it does the work for you to grow your wealth. Misused, it becomes a financial anchor that drags you down and makes getting ahead exponentially (com..poundingly? sorry.) harder. Understanding and respecting the power of interest is a huge step in taking control of your financial future.\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/interest/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAn explainer on interest and why it\u0026rsquo;s both awesome and terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to personal finance, interest is one of the most potent forces as play.

We\u0026rsquo;ll get into the why\u0026rsquo;s here shortly and tackle the \u0026lsquo;what\u0026rsquo; it is here first. Typically an employer will match something like \u0026lsquo;X% up to Y%\u0026rsquo;, so if they say they\u0026rsquo;ll match 50% up to 6% that is another annoying finance word choice that basically translates to \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll match 3%, but you\u0026rsquo;ve got to contribute at least 6% for us to do that\u0026rdquo;.\nSo, what exactly are they matching? Your pre-tax dollars from your paycheck. We finally get to stick it to Uncle Sam (until we need it in retirement\u0026hellip; dude always gets his cut eventually) and take a portion of that perfect paycheck and throw it into a retirement account before he gets his grubby claws on it (state/federal taxes + social security). Your employer then puts in a contribution of their own based on that match percentage you signed up for when you got hired.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll hear a lot of people say \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s free money!\u0026rdquo;, but it does actually cost you in that by contributing to retirement you\u0026rsquo;re not getting dollars in hand at the time. Obviously I\u0026rsquo;m going to advocate for you getting your full employer match, but I always thought that was a weird way of putting it as it most definitely costs you something. An additional excellent benefit of an employer match is that if you are in a position to fully max out your 401(k) every year (2024: $23,000/year) then the contribution from your employer does NOT go toward that, so you effectively get to overfill your retirement contribution.\nIf you are willing and able to contribute to your 401(k), there is absolutely no reason to not try and hit the maximum match percentage from your employer - it isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily free, but if you are going to contribute anyway, then I would say your minimum contribution should be hitting that percentage to get your full employer match.\nLess immediate advantages In addition to the money your employer contributes to your account every paycheck, there\u0026rsquo;s also the fact that by taking the money from your pre-tax paycheck, that your taxable income is lowered as that number is calculated on.. well, your taxable income - and that 401(k) contribution is not taxable. So you reduce your taxable income, you reduce your taxes for the year - neat.\nProbably the biggest advantage is the fact that by going into a retirement account, that money is expected to earn interest over time. Compound interest is a very powerful tool in building wealth over long periods of time, so that extra few percent that your employer matches can end up turning into a good chunk of money by the time you get to use it.\nQuick example Not rocket surgery here, but let\u0026rsquo;s say (using our same example of employer match at 50% of 6% otherwise known as a 3% match):\nYou make $50,000 a year You decide to contribute 6% of your salary ($3,000) to your 401(k) Your employer will add another 50% of that amount ($1,500) to your account Now instead of just having $3,000, you have $4,500 in your retirement account Your taxable income falls by the $3,000 you contributed and is now at $47,000 (when you do your taxes, you get to use this number instead of the full $50,000).\nWrap up Keep in mind that the 3% match is just an example; you\u0026rsquo;ll need to check with your employer to find out their specific rate (if they even offer one) to get accurate information. Remember, it\u0026rsquo;s not necessarily \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; money. For instance, if you\u0026rsquo;re saving for a house and decide to pause your retirement contributions, you\u0026rsquo;d potentially get a significant boost to your ability to save that down payment quicker. That being said, if it\u0026rsquo;s financially feasible, I strongly believe that meeting at least the employer match is greatly beneficial in the long run.\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/employer-match/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s an employer match and should I do it?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou got a new gig and they\u0026rsquo;re offering you an employer match for your 401(k), what does it mean, how do I do it, why should I do it?

Not to mention there’s not a thing any of us can individually do to fix it. However, what inflation is and why should I care? That I can do.\nPut as simply as I can understand and convey it: the same amount of money that used to buy something, can no longer buy that same amount or same quality of thing. That’s it. Something that used to cost you $3 now costs you $3.50 and if you haven’t increased your income to offset these increased costs, everything else you can spend money on gets squeezed a little bit more.\nAdditionally, inflation doesn’t typically happen in a vacuum. It’s not just a gallon of milk increasing; it’s also the eggs, the chicken, ground beef, rubber, lumber, metal, Incan matrimonial headmasks, etc. Everything gets a little harder to purchase as we feel the repercussions of some piece of some supply chain somewhere getting hit by an increased cost, and… well, shit rolls down hill.\nEvery step your banana took - from getting cut down in some tropical country, to the vehicles that transported it to the import storage, to the vehicle that took it across the state(s), to the grocery store, to the person who stocked it - every single step was affected by the same inflation impacting us. These increased costs are funneled down the entire way until they land on our counters.\nHow Does Inflation Affect You? Purchasing Power: The most immediate effect of inflation is the reduction in purchasing power. Simply put, your money doesn’t go as far as it used to. This can be especially hard on those with fixed incomes, like retirees.\nSavings and Investments: Inflation can erode the value of your savings. If your savings account offers a 2% interest rate, but inflation is at 3%, your money is effectively still losing value. Luckily, as of the time of writing this - we have some awesome savings options in high-yield (online) savings accounts getting upwards of 4%. I personally use Discover’s at ~4% right now just because I’ve been with them a while but there are higher rates out there.\nDebt: On the flip side, inflation can actually be beneficial for borrowers. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, the value of the money you owe decreases in real terms. You\u0026rsquo;re paying back your loan with \u0026ldquo;cheaper\u0026rdquo; dollars… yay.\nShow me numbers Let\u0026rsquo;s say you have $10,000 in a savings account with a 1% annual interest rate. Over the course of a year, you’ll earn $100 in interest. However, if the inflation rate is 3%, the purchasing power of your $10,000 is reduced by $300, effectively leaving you with $9,700 in terms of purchasing power. Isn’t being at the mercy of something completely out of your control great?\nWrap up That’s about it, like I mentioned earlier, inflation waving arms around in its entirety, is very complex and has a lot of nuance and moving parts involved. However, the actual core concept of what inflation is and how it affects everyone is a bit easier to grasp (even if it does have quite a bit of complexity when you dig into the breadth of things it affects). As far as defending against inflation goes, the best way is the same way you defend against most financial risk: diversify where your money is at if you have the ability to do so. However, most people don’t have the ability to make sure they have a nice tidy split of real estate, long-term investments, short-term investments, etc. So for most folks the answer is: deal with it and hopefully be prepared for it when it happens.\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/inflation/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA summary on inflation and how it affects multiple aspects of our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy inflation happens and what is done to combat it on a country-wide economic scale is way beyond the scope of what I feel comfortable talking about (I am much too dumb).

Nothing here is going to be rocket science, but I have found after helping a couple dozen friends and family in my life that the vast majority of them have huge knowledge gaps in everything from how a credit card works to ‘what stocks do I pick to be a millionaire in like.. 6 months?’ (spoiler: no one knows, and if they say they do - run).\nI also don’t know everything, but I am an avid reader and I am passionate about finance and started my journey to understanding how this stuff works about 10 years ago when I was (at the time) a college dropout and bartending and/or waiting tables. My wife and I have been cup ramen and food stamps broke, we’ve been in 6 figure debt and, more importantly, were absolutely, unequivocally, stupid about money in our early 20’s.\nLike so many of my peers (I’m 35 now), I was told ‘Go to college, take on debt to pay for it, and when you’re done you’ll be set for life!’. What I wasn’t told about was ‘interest’. Of course I had a vague idea of what interest was, but do you think I wrote out an attack plan for how I was going to pay off $30,000 of school debt at varying interest rates in the 5-10% range? Absolutely not, I bought a sweet gaming PC and promptly dropped out of college after my first two years. Then I tried the whole college thing again a couple years later, and dropped out again with another $25,000 of debt on top of the previous (that I hadn’t even BEGUN to think about paying off). I did eventually graduate, but all told it took me about 8 years to get my Bachelor’s degree, and I ended the ordeal with about $75,000 of debt (about the same amount for my wife). On top of that, we had credit card debt, not because we couldn’t afford to eat at this point, but because we wanted cool stuff, and all our friends were buying stuff with credit cards and FOMO is a hell of an influencer when you’re still figuring out what you want to do in life.\nI wasn’t taught about 401k’s, I wasn’t taught about planning for retirement, I wasn’t taught about credit cards, not compound interest, not credit scores, nada. But I could absolutely put my name down on those loans at 18 years old, I could absolutely apply for those credit cards that came in the mail a week after my 18th birthday, and I could absolutely (and DID) royally screw up. To be clear, it was absolutely my own fault, but truly, even a basic understanding of how a credit card works would have been a step up from my initial ignorance.\nSo all that to say: I’ve been there, I’ve lived it, and, if possible, I’d like to make sure that no one has to repeat my mistakes because fixing them has taken years, tears, and more money than I like to think about. I’m currently sitting on ~830 credit score, the only debt I’ve got is my house and the family car (no regrets, I’ve got a gd minivan and I love it), and I’m much more confident in the financial decisions I’ve made for myself and my family. I’ve had a lot of success helping friends navigate through their own financial woes, I’m that guy in the friend group who ‘knows money stuff’, and I’m eager to do my best to help educate anyone who cares to listen and would like to also feel the comfort of being confident in making financial decisions for their future.\nAgain, thanks for reading and I genuinely hope that the information I share here is useful to you in helping you make your own financial decisions in a way that you understand and feel confident about.\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/about/","summary":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am, what I\u0026rsquo;m about, and what this can help with.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy goal isn’t to tell anyone what to do, but to educate as many people as possible in how some of this stuff actually works in a way that’s easy to digest without getting too dragged down into the mud of complicated financial terms.

As of 2024, it\u0026rsquo;s around 24% APR (annual percentage rate), which is an annoying way of saying about 2% every month. You can take your credit card’s APR and divide it by 12 to calculate the interest that will accrue on your balance each month. That ‘each month’ aspect of credit card interest makes it easy to fall into debt quickly if you’re not careful. If you bite off more than you can chew, you don’t have much time to fix the situation before the interest adds up. Let’s get into it.\nShow me the numbers Let’s run through an example of how quickly credit card debt can grow if you only make minimum payments. We\u0026rsquo;ll assume a starting balance of $1,000, an APR of 24%, and a minimum payment of $25.\nMonth-by-Month Breakdown Initial Balance: $1,000\nMonthly Interest Rate: 24% (APR) / 12 (months) = 2%\nMonth 1: Interest for the Month: $1,000 * 2% = $20\nNew Balance: $1,000 + $20 = $1,020\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,020 - $25 = $995\nMonth 2: Interest for the Month: $995 * 2% = $19.90\nNew Balance: $995 + $19.90 = $1,014.90\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,014.90 - $25 = $989.90\nMonth 3: Interest for the Month: $989.90 * 2% = $19.80\nNew Balance: $989.90 + $19.80 = $1,009.70\nMinimum Payment: $25\nBalance After Payment: $1,009.70 - $25 = $984.70\nSummary: Month 1: Start with $1,000, end with $995.\nMonth 2: Start with $995, end with $989.90.\nMonth 3: Start with $989.90, end with $984.70.\nNotice that despite making the minimum payment each month, the balance only reduces by a small amount (not $25), and a significant portion of each payment goes toward interest. After the 3rd month, you’ve paid $75(!) but the balance itself has only decreased by about $15 - the rest of that money went straight to your card company’s pocket. Poof, worst magic trick ever.\nIn fact, if you were to only pay minimum payments on that initial $1,000 balance it would take you almost 6 YEARS to pay it off, and in that time you would have paid over $1,000 in INTEREST (math). So to spend $1000, you spent $2000 - this is an extreme example in terms of length of time, but a very mild example when it comes to credit card balances. I’m pretty sure my first credit card at 18 had a $5,000 limit and I didn’t have $5,000 cash until I was well established in my career… at like 30 years old.\nSo… credit card bad? Not necessarily, it’s kind of like a chainsaw… useful if you know what you’re doing but probably better to leave to someone else if you don’t.\nLuckily, understanding the stuff I listed above (not chainsaws, the credit card part) here more than likely puts you ahead of more of your friends and family than you’d be comfortable with.\nCredit cards can absolutely be beneficial, not just for building credit but also for the various perks and point systems they offer. My family and I primarily use the AMEX Gold card since a huge chunk of our monthly spending goes towards groceries (…and dining out…), both of which earn bonus points on that particular card. I won’t go into details or breakdowns of which credit card is right for you, as there are a ton of resources out there (I personally like nerdwallet’s comparisons and breakdowns). Suffice it to say, there is likely a card that will give you the best bang for your buck based on your spending habits.\nMy family puts everything possible on that AMEX, but we also ensure we have the cash to cover every transaction and pay off the balance in full every month. This strategy is great for points but not super beneficial for building credit, as credit companies like to see you can ‘responsibly’ carry a balance forward to future months (including the interest you’d get by not paying it off in full).\nIf building credit is something you need to do, you could keep a small balance (an amount you could pay off in full at any point) on a card and make either minimum payments or some other amount not in full, allowing that card to incur some interest charges as you pay it off over a few months. Once you’re near zeroing out the card, put some more purchases on it and then repeat the process as needed. By keeping only an amount on the card that you could pay off at any point, you can feel comfortable carrying that balance and the minor interest charges that would be incurred over a few months as opposed to a few years.\nThanks for reading!\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/credit-card-interest/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA brief explainer on what your credit card interest looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCredit card interest is typically very high. As of 2024, it\u0026rsquo;s around 24% APR (annual percentage rate), which is an annoying way of saying about 2% every month. You can take your credit card’s APR and divide it by 12 to calculate the interest that will accrue on your balance each month. That ‘each month’ aspect of credit card interest makes it easy to fall into debt quickly if you’re not careful. If you bite off more than you can chew, you don’t have much time to fix the situation before the interest adds up.

The more you eat, the higher the tier you move into, but you only pay that higher price for the food you eat in that tier. In the U.S., tax brackets work similarly: your income is divided into chunks, and each chunk is taxed at a different rate. So, if you earn more, only the extra income in the higher bracket gets taxed at the higher rate, not your entire paycheck.\nShow me some examples Say you make $50,000 per year. When you break this down within the tax brackets (2022), it looks like:\n$10,275 taxed at 10% $31,500 taxed at 12% $8,225 taxed at 22% Math: Tier 1 ($0 - $10,275 @ 10%) Taxes taken out: $10,275 x .10 = $1,027.50\nMoney taken home: $10,275 - $1,027.50 = $9,247.50\nTier 2 ($10,276 - $41,775 @ 12%) Taxes taken out: $31,500 x .12 = $3,780\nMoney taken home: $31,500 - $3,780 = $27,720\nTier 3 ($41,776 - $50,000 @ 22%) Taxes taken out: $8,225 x .22 = $1,809.50\nMoney taken home: $8,225 - $1,809.50 = $6,415.50\nSo, in total:\nTaxes taken out: $1,027.50 + $3,780 + $1,809.50 = $6,617\nMoney taken home: $50,000 - $6,617 = $43,383\nThat, of course, is not the last of what’s going to be taken out of your paycheck - you’ve still got Social Security (6.2% as of 2023), state taxes (if your state has income tax), and any retirement/insurance(s)/etc. that you’ve elected to have withheld on your check.\nBoth Social Security and state income taxes are taken out at a flat rate, so you can just take that total income of $50,000 and multiply it by those percentages:\nSocial Security at 6.2%: $50,000 × 0.062 = $3,100\nThen a state income tax (example) at 5%: $50,000 × 0.05 = $2,500\nSo for someone earning $50,000 a year in a state with 5% income tax:\n$50,000 pre-tax income\n$6,617 in federal taxes\n$3,100 in Social Security\n$2,500 in state income tax\nLeaving them with a total of $37,783 take home pay before we factor in any health and/or life insurance, putting any money into an employer retirement account, or any other things they’ve elected to withhold from their check.\nSo, before any of that money lands in your account, you can count on just about 25% of it going to Uncle Sam and his folks - which is why having an employer-sponsored retirement account can be extremely beneficial as most of these use pre-tax dollars. This allows you to effectively reduce the amount of money going to taxes and save some for your future self via your retirement account (though Uncle Sam does eventually get his cut, at that point it will, hopefully, not affect your day-to-day spending quite so much).\nBonus I\u0026rsquo;ve come across several people in my life who say, \u0026lsquo;Oh, you better watch that raise though, it will end up with you in a higher tax bracket! It may not be worth it.\u0026rsquo; \u0026hellip;. which is just \u0026hellip; so wrong it hurts. That\u0026rsquo;s like saying you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t eat more cake because you\u0026rsquo;ll need a bigger plate. Yes, you’ll pay a bit more tax on the extra money (and only that extra money!), but you\u0026rsquo;ll still end up with more cake in the end. Err, money.\nThanks for reading!\nJake\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/tax-brackets/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA brief explainer on tax brackets and your paycheck.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"breakdown\"\u003eBreakdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine you\u0026rsquo;re at an all-you-can-eat buffet with different price tiers based on the amount of food you actually consume.
